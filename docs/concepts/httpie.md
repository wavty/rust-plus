# HTTPie Design Overview

## Introduction

HTTPie is a command-line tool designed to make HTTP requests easy and intuitive for developers. Built in Rust, HTTPie provides a more user-friendly and aesthetically-pleasing interface than other popular tools like curl.

In this design overview, we'll explore the key features of HTTPie, its design goals, and how it works under the hood.

## Features

HTTPie comes packed with features that make it a powerful tool for making HTTP requests. Some of the key features include:

- Syntax highlighting of request/response bodies
- JSON and form data support
- Customizable output formatting
- HTTPS support
- Support for authentication
- Support for cookies
- Support for proxies
- Support for timeouts
- And much more!

## Design Goals

HTTPie was designed with several goals in mind, including:

- Simplicity: HTTPie aims to make HTTP requests simple and intuitive for developers of all levels of experience.
- User-friendly: HTTPie's output is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to read, with syntax highlighting and other visual aids.
- Customizable: HTTPie provides a range of options for customizing the output of HTTP requests, including output formatting, headers, and more.
- Extensible: HTTPie is built on a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and customize with new plugins and features.

## Architecture

HTTPie is built in Rust, a systems programming language known for its speed, safety, and concurrency. Under the hood, HTTPie consists of several key components, including:

- The HTTP client: This is the core component of HTTPie, responsible for making HTTP requests and handling responses. The HTTP client is built on top of Rust's `reqwest` library, which provides a high-level HTTP client API.
- The parser: HTTPie's parser is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and constructing HTTP requests. The parser uses Rust's `clap` library, a powerful command-line argument parser, to handle command-line arguments.
- The output formatter: HTTPie's output formatter is responsible for formatting the output of HTTP requests in a user-friendly and aesthetically-pleasing way. The output formatter uses Rust's `serde` library to serialize data into various output formats, including JSON, YAML, and others.

## Conclusion

HTTPie is a powerful, user-friendly command-line tool for making HTTP requests, built in Rust. With its customizable output formatting, support for various HTTP features, and modular architecture, HTTPie is a great tool for developers of all levels of experience.
